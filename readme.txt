Implementation Instructions


Visual studio code 
Visual studio code is the IDE our group used, our team recommended this IDE but other IDE are fine. Visual studio code is used to alter the code is a simple manner and will need to be used when working on the website to code functionality and alter the location

Google API
To implement the location function it's best to use the Google API. The code below is used to add and remove the branch location from the website and although it can be altered manually it is best to use the google API to increase accuracy. 


Web browser 
The code needs a web browser to function and works on all common web browsers. 


Xampp or Wamp
In order to use the website it should be connected to the local host first using as Xampp or Wamp. It is a good idea to upscale this in the future and host on the web to make it more accessible to everyone. Local host was used for production purposes but is always meant to be hosted online. 
Links on instructions to implement Xampp and Wamp are below

Wamp: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-and-set-up-a-wamp-server/

Data migration 
All database information is in the json file. It is best to have multiple local copy to ensure no loss of data. Data migration is easy to implement as you can save or move the json files to whatever is required.
